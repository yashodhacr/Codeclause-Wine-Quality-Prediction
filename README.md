# CodeClause-Wine-Quality-Prediction

----------------------------

 A large dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to analyse the quality of wine through different parameters like total_phenols,color_intensity etc...All these parameters will be analysed through Machine Learning algorithms like random forest classifier algorithm and decision tree algorithm which will helps to rate the wine on scale 1 - 10 or bad - good.Output obtained would further be checked for correctness and model will be optimized accordingly.
